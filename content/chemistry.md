Like physics, competitive chemistry problems fall into various fields, although it's more likely here that (at a high level) a problem may involve completely new ideas. As such, there are a lot of fields that need to be covered - **analytical**, **biochemistry**, **kinetics**, **inorganic**, **organic**, **thermodynamics** - as well as some **miscellaneous** topics (such as practice techniques).

For samples, you may wish to look at the following:
- [(Junior) Bonding](bonding.md)
- [(Intermediate) Organic Chemistry](organic_intro.md)
- [(Senior) Crystal Field Theory](cft.md)

Junior | Intermediate | Senior
--- | --- | ---
Analytical | Redox and Equilibrium | Analytical
Bonding | Structures | Kinetics
Inorganic | Inorganic | CFT
Organic | Biochemistry | Organic
Thermodynamics | Orbitals | Thermodynamics
