Competitive physics has multiple important fields in which problems may be sorted. Some are more prevalent that others, so we can broadly classify them into 5 sections - **mechanics**, **electromagnetism**, **thermodynamics**, **waves + optics**, and **quantum + relativity** (where the last two are grouped together more due to obscurity than similarity).

For samples, you may wish to look at the following:
- [(Basic) Linear Motion](linear_motion.md)
- [(Intermediate) Introduction to Electromagnetism](emag_intro.md)
- [(Advanced) Euler-Lagrange](euler_lagrange.md)
