Competitive physics has multiple important fields in which problems may be sorted. Some are more prevalent that others, so we can broadly classify them into 5 sections - **mechanics**, **electromagnetism**, **thermodynamics**, **waves + optics**, and **nuclear, quantum, relativity**.

For samples, you may wish to look at the following:
- [(Junior) Linear Motion](linear_motion.md)
- [(Intermediate) Electromagnetism](emag_intro.md)
- [(Senior) Euler-Lagrange](euler_lagrange.md)

Junior | Intermediate | Senior
--- | --- | ---
Electromagnetism | Electromagnetism | Electromagnetism
Mechanics | Mechanics | Euler-Lagrange
Heat | Thermo A | Relativity
Nuclear | Thermo B | Quantum
Waves | Optics | Waves
