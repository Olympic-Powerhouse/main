For competitive mathematics, there are four genres: **algebra**, **combinatorics**, **geometry**, and **number theory**. Some questions may involve a mix of the genres - **combinatorial geometry** is perhaps the most famous one - however these are very rare, and 90% of problems will cleanly fall into one of these categories.

For samples, you may wish to look at the following:
- [(Junior) Circle Geometry](basic_circle_geo.md)
- [(Intermediate) Inequalities](inequalities.md)
- [(Senior) Moving Points](moving_points.md)
