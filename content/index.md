## How do we work?

This program is inspired by a couple of really great programs across the world: notably, the OTIS program run by Evan Chen, which is an American program designed for US math competitions.

To make sure there's flexibility around what the students want to learn, whilst retaining a proper system of teacher, I use a system of **units**.

This works as follows: for each subject, there are a list of *units* - which are specific topics within that subject. For example, a unit in chemistry might be *acids*. Each unit consists of a handout, which contains important information like theorems and formulas, and a set of problems (which are assigned to the student). They also have values based on how many lectures it will take me to cover the content during class, as well as difficulty ratings.

Difficulties range from the following:
- **Junior**: These courses are designed for **Junior Science** students, as well as an introduction to students who may be less familiar with certain topics
- **Intermediate**: These are more advanced, and are good for students who are seriously competiting for a spot at the olympiad training camps.
- **Advanced**: This is the most difficult level, good for students already competiting at a national level. Generally not recommended unless otherwise suggested by me.

For example, a unit titled **Junior: Linear Motion (2)** would take 2 hour-long lessons to cover, and would be a junior level course.
