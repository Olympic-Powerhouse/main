## Tutoring


## Mentoring

It may be the case that you want to prepare for competitions, but are unable to commit to a dedicated tutoring system, or simply prefer to learn your own way - and that's perfectly fine! Many students are in similar situations: it happened to me as well, where I didn't have the time to try both a tutor's set problems *and* do practice papers on the side.
