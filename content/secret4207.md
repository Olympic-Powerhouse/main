## Tutoring


## Mentoring

It may be the case that you want to prepare for competitions, but are unable to commit to a dedicated tutoring system, or simply prefer to learn your own way - and that's perfectly fine! Many students are in similar situations: it happened to me as well, where I didn't have the time to try both a tutor's set problems *and* do practice papers on the side.

That is the purpose of the mentoring system. Heavily inspired by (in fact, almost identical to) the mentor program used by the Australian Mathematics Trust to train the International Mathematical Olympiad team, the way this program works is very simple: students recieved a personalised problem set at the start of each week, consisting of problems aimed at their skill level from across the entire subject. They will then work on these problems, and submit as much progress as possible by the end of the week. Over the following week, in which they will have another set, I will mark their work, return it with a score (if applicable), and provide feedback and solutions.
